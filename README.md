# MXCarkit ROS2 Humble Workspace

In theory, it is best practice to use the official ROS Docker images from Nvidia, available at [https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers/tree/master](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers/tree/master). While the installation works and ROS runs stably, installing additional packages can be challenging. Therefore, we instead used the official Docker image from ROS itself, available at [https://hub.docker.com/_/ros/](https://hub.docker.com/_/ros/), and have successfully tested it on JetPack 5.1.
